The Spirit of Rogue
===================

A game that embodies the Spirit of Rogue has:

* Permadeath
* Emergent gameplay
* Complex, interlocking game systems
* Procedurally generated levels that look and play differently each and every game
* A sense of progression
* No, or at least strictly limited, meta progression

Note what this does not require:

* Text based, console graphics
* Turn-based play
* Topdown view
* Fantasy or dungeon theme
* Defined ending

I avoid using the loaded terms Rogue-like or Rogue-lite.
